# Thalamic-mean-field
The core numerical codes for simulating a thalamic spiking network and mean-field used in the paper 'A Multi-scale study of Thalamic Responsiveness' are represented here. Two paramter sets are initiated corresponding to the 'awake' and 'sleep' states defined via the concentration of Acetycholine in the thalamus, as in the paper.
